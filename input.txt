The suffixes -(k¨u)le- denote a state. A telic verb which contains -(k¨u)le-, is result-oriented. An
                    atelic verb which contains one of these suffixes is event-oriented. The change
                        of state which is the result of an event denoted by a telic verb is attributed to
                                                                              the intransitive subject or to the patient of the corresponding perfective
With certain verbs, the suffix -(k¨u)le- denotes either a change of state which
is the result of an earlier event or an ongoing event. Compare:
(1) po -k¨ule-y
dirty-st28-ind4-33
‘he is dirty’
(2) m¨uchay-ke
soon-distr
po -k¨ule-w-¨uy
dirty-st28-ref31-ind4-33
‘he is getting dirtier and dirtier’
(3) a˜ni -k¨ule-y
get.hot/scorch-st28-ind4-33
‘he has been scorched’, ‘it is scorching’
(4) a˜ni -kon-k¨ule-y
get.hot/scorch-enter-st28-ind4-33
‘it is scorching’
(5) wiri-le-y
write-st28-ind4-33
‘it is written’
(6) wiri-kon-k¨ule-y
write-enter-st28-ind4-33
‘he is writing’
For the verb kon- ‘to enter’ in compound verbs, see 29.1.
It is not always clear beforehand whether a -(k¨u)le- form is result-oriented or
event-oriented or both. Compare for instance the verb k¨ullew- ‘to burst open’
(of grain), which behaves like an atelic verb (k¨ullew-k¨ule-y ‘it is bursting open’),
and the verb pawk¨u- ‘to burst open, to explode’ (of an egg or gas bottle), which
behaves like a telic verb (pawk¨u-le-y ‘it is exploded’). Take for instance tripa-
‘to leave’, which behaves like an atelic verb (tripa-le-y ‘he is leaving’), and
tripa- ‘to go out’, which behaves like a telic verb (tripa-le-y ‘he is outside’).
Also compare atelic witra- ‘to pull’ (witra-le-y ‘he is pulling’) and telic witra-
‘to get up’ (witra-le-y ‘he is standing’).
has acquired as a result of an earlier process or event. Apparently the verbs
mentioned above do not result in a change of characteristics of the patient.
They do not denote a process or event which results in a present feature of the
subject. Likewise, *rapi-le-y ‘it is vomited’ or *muntu-le-y ‘it is taken away’ are
unacceptable utterances. Instead, the passive rapi-nge-y ‘it has been vomited’
or muntu-nge-y ‘it has been taken away’ should be used.
Factitive verbs which have an incorporated object or are derived from a noun
behave like atelic verbs.
A result-oriented -(k¨u)le- form is used to denote a non-intrinsic quality, i.e.
a quality which is the result of an earlier process or event, or a temporary quality.
The verbalizer -nge-36 (21.2) denotes the presence of an intrinsic quality.
Compare the following -(k¨u)le- and -nge- forms:
k¨untro-le-y ‘he limps’; k¨untro-nge-y ‘he is lame’
fentre-le-y ‘they are many’ (Sp. est´an muchos); fentre-nge-y ‘they are many’
(Sp. son muchos)
welu- uam-k¨ule-y ‘he is/has gone out of his mind’; welu- uam-nge-y ‘he is
crazy’
pilu-le-y ‘he is deaf’ (temporarily or he is pretending to be deaf); pilu-nge-y
‘he is deaf’ (always)
kallf¨u-le-y/kallf¨u-y ‘it is blue’; kallf¨u-nge-y ‘it is blue’ (always)
The suffixes -nge- verb36 and -(k¨u)le- may co-occur. Their combination is
infrequent. It means that the subject temporarily finds itself in a state of
having the intrinsic quality denoted by the root.
(7) witran-nge-le-pa-y
visitor-verb36-st28-hh17-ind4-33
‘he is a visitor here’ (he is behaving formally, as a visitor)
(8) nge-n-nge-le-lu
have-pvn4-verb36-st28-svn4
‘the one who is the owner/boss’ (lit.: he who is being the one who is the one who has)
The suffix -nge- verb36 may indicate a weather condition or celestial phenomenon:
(9) ale-nge-le-y
moon-verb36-st28-ind4-33
‘the moon is still there’
A -(k¨u)le- form is intransitive and cannot take a slot 6 filler. This implies
that verbs which logically need a patient do not take the morpheme -(k¨u)le-.
Thus, *utu-le-y does not occur. Instead, the expression utu-nie-fi-y ‘he is
approaching it’ is found. Instead of the expressions *ngoyma-le-y and *pe-le-y,
the expressions ngoy-ma-nie-fi-y ‘he forgets it’ and pe-nie-fi-y ‘he sees it’ are
found.
A -(k¨u)le- form may occur with an incorporated object (10), with an instrumental
object (11) or with a complement noun phrase (12).
(10) kintu-k¨u aw-k¨ule-n
look.for-work-st28-ind1s3
‘I am looking for work’
(11) raki uam-k¨ule-n
think-st28-ind1s3
fey-mew
he-inst
‘I am thinking of him’
(12) raki uam-k¨ule-n
think-st28-ind1s3
˜ni

tripa-yal
leave-nrld9.ovn4
‘I am thinking of leaving’
Verbs which denote a lasting situation and are not marked with the suffix -anrld9
denote a situation which is an actual fact and may continue to be so up
to the present moment. Such verbs may be translated in the present or past
tense. For the sake of brevity, -(k¨u)le- and -meke- forms are translated in the
present tense only.
